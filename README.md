introducing a web site on musical instruments with all it's history and intro

This project showcases the collaborative effort of a group of 1st-year students at the Informatics Institute of Technology. We have created a comprehensive website that explores the rich history of music instruments and modern instruments. The website is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, incorporating various interactive features to enhance the user experience.

Features
Home Page: The home page serves as the entry point to our website. It provides an overview of the project and invites users to explore further. We have implemented interactive elements using JavaScript to enhance the navigation and provide a dynamic user experience.

OnClick JS Functions: Throughout the website, we have utilized JavaScript's onclick functions to enable interactive elements, such as buttons and images. These functions allow users to trigger specific actions, such as displaying additional information or navigating to other pages.

Query Page: The query page offers users the ability to search for specific instruments based on various criteria, including instrument type, era, or country of origin. This feature provides an intuitive and efficient way for users to find the information they are interested in.

Product Page: The product page showcases a selection of modern musical instruments available for purchase. Users can browse through the collection, view detailed product information, and add items to their cart. This feature adds an interactive and e-commerce aspect to our website.

Small Quiz Page: To engage users and test their knowledge, we have included a small quiz page. Users can participate in a fun and educational quiz that challenges their understanding of music instruments. This interactive feature adds an element of gamification to the website.

Thumbnail Page: The thumbnail page presents a visual overview of the website's content. Users can quickly navigate to specific sections by clicking on the thumbnails, providing a convenient way to explore the website's extensive content.

Enhanced Sitemap: Our website includes a comprehensive sitemap that outlines the website's structure and facilitates easy navigation. The sitemap enables users to understand the overall organization of the content and quickly locate specific pages or sections.

Conclusion
We are proud to present this collaborative effort by our group of 1st-year students at the Informatics Institute of Technology. Through this project, we have created a visually appealing and interactive website that explores the history of music instruments and modern instruments. By combining HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, we have provided an engaging user experience with features like onclick functions, query capabilities, a product page, a small quiz, and an enhanced sitemap. We hope that our website serves as a valuable resource for anyone interested in learning about music instruments throughout history.
